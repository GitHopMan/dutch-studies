Exploring the Dutch academic landscape

by Lars Idema, Feb. 2020

This repository contains code and data to build a graph database
of all HBO/WO studies in the Netherlands.

After building you can explore the graph database by clicking on the nodes
and expanding them to see relations, e.g. which city is this university in,
what are related studies and where can I study them?

The code is in Cypher, native language of Neo4j, the leading graph database.
The Neo4j database can be run locally (free download at their site)
or hosted at e.g. Google Cloud Engine (I tried 1 yr free).
Google+Neo4j provide a virtual machine for easy set-up.

It's a lot of fun to explore this database, especially for high school
students finding the education of their liking.

Let's kick some balls!
